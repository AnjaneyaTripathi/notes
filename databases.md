# Designing Data Intensive Applications

## Introduction

**What is a data-intensive application?**

Any application that has data as a bottleneck, ie. 
- quantity of data, 
- complexity of data,
- speed at which data is changing

[Compute intesive is when CPU cycles are the bottleneck]

## 1. Reliable, Scalable and Maintanable Applications

**Reliable**: Tolerating hardware and software faults (due to human error)

**Scalability**: Measuring load and performance, latency percentiles and throughput

**Maintainability**: Operability, evolvability and simplicity

**Fault vs. Failure**: A fault is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user.
